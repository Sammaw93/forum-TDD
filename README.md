Created a TDD forum based upon the Laracast series, i've used a virtual box with homestead for this project.

The idea behind this repo was to continue building on my backend laravel experience while taking a test driven approach.

Its still a work in progress due to more features needing adding and certain forms need fixing but the main focus is the BE logic and testing.
